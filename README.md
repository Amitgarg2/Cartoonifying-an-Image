# Cartoonifying-an-Image

This project showcases a real-time cartoonification technique for video frames using Python and
OpenCV. By capturing live video from a camera, the application transforms each frame into a cartoon
like image through color reduction with k-means clustering and brightness enhancement. This process
simplifies the color palette and adds a vibrant, stylized effect to the video feed, creating a
visually engaging cartoon effect.

The script efficiently processes the video stream, applying k-means clustering to reduce the
image's color complexity and making the colors more vivid. The result is a cartoonized version of
the live video, displayed in a window that updates in real-time. This project demonstrates
practical applications of image processing techniques and offers a foundation for further
enhancements in visual effects and real-time image manipulation.
